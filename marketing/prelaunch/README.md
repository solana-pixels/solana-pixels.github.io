# The following channels will be leveraged prelaunch

## Channels

Twitter is the main channel for "out-of-network"/high impact eyeballs. There is need for longer form content as well. Tweets should be branded in the sense that if they carry extended content, that content is rendered as a jpg using scheme appropriate color/font.

### twitter@solanapixels

Tweet stream follows:

* Is it art? Is it a  game? Is it an NFT? @solanapixels
* Community generated NFTs generate community @solanapixels
* DeFi Gamified @solanapixels

### discord@solanapixels

### LinkedIn

This is a curious channel. I think the approach should be to point LI posts at tweets or at our documentation. I also think that one of my "spaghetti at the wall" projects might serve here. secede.finance/secedefi.io/com. The idea is to market solanapixels as DeFi education.
