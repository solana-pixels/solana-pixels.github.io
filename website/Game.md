# A Decentralized Art Game

Pixels is a project based upon the idea of community creation and showcasing the power of blockchain. The game is meant to spark creativity and fun, while also introducing users to blockchain concepts and the speed of the Solana network. As with many blockchain projects, we believe there are many exciting use cases ahead.

## The Game

The shared canvas of the Pixels game is a 500 x 500 grid of cells (pixels!) stored on the Solana blockchain. A player can initiate a Solana transaction for a given pixel which will set the color of the pixel and "lock" the pixel for 1 hour. Users can collaborate to draw messages, project logos, or whatever designs they can think of!

With the power of the Solana blockchain, Pixel transactions are extremely cheap (0.0001 SOL) and 80% of the fees are returned to the Pixel community via the PXL pool. The remaining 20% will go toward project costs such as paying developers    and upgrading RPC nodes as use increases.
