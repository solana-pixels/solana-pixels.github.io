# Pixels: A Decentralized Art Game

## The Game
Pixels is a decentralized art game running on Solana. Pixel players are able to work together to draw on a shared canvas which is stored on the Solana blockchain.


## The Token
PIXEL is the project token that unlocks the game economy of Pixels. Players can get PIXEL by drawing on the canvas or swapping at PIXEL pools.


## The NFTs
The state of the community canvas is stored securely on the Solana blockchain. Periodically that state is captured and minted as an NFT. The NFT is only minted if the canvas has changed, so each NFT represents a unique piece of art created by the Pixel community!
