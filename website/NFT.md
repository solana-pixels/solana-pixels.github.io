# The NFTs - Coming Soon

Pixels is a game for expressing creativity and a platform for creating decentralized art. As part of that, we believe in creating something permanent that showcases the creativity of the community while also embracing self-custody and decentralization. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) created with periodic snapshots of the shared canvas allow players to document, collect, and showcase the artwork that the community creates.

NFTs will only be minted if the contents of the shared canvas have changed since the last NFT was created, and only if the canvas state is unique. This ensures each NFT is guaranteed to be a unique creation by the Pixels community. 

Disclaimer: Details are subject to change as the NFT implementation work progresses.

## Schedule
 NFTs will be minted at a rate of one a week on a fixed schedule.
