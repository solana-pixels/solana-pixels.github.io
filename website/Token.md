# Pixel Tokenomics

As part of coloring a pixel on the shared canvas, players will receive PXL tokens as rewards. PXL tokens represent participation in the creation process, as well as unlocking opportunities to take part in the game economy by participating in liquidity pools. The best way to get PXL is by coloring pixels!

## Player Rewards
Player rewards are calculated by taking the remaining supply of the rewards token account and dividing it by 25,000. The token account will be initially loaded with 250,000 PXL so rewards will start at 10 PXL tokens.

## Liquidity Pool
The liquidity pool is initially created and funded by the Pixels team. Players can use this pool to trade their rewards for SOL or join the pool and earn transaction fees. The pool will receive 80% of the transaction fees generated by drawing operations, so the more people draw on the canvas, the more SOL is deposited into the pool!

## Token Allocation
Upon creation of the project, 650,000 PXL tokens will be minted and the token mint will be locked so that no further tokens can be created. From this initial allocation, the team will then create and fund the liquidity pool as well as the player rewards account. Given that the mint is locked, the remaining tokens will be held in reserve for use as the project evolves.
